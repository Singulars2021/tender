### App description

These days, It can take a long time to adopt a pet. Where should you search it for? What kind of trust do all those pages where you can find them advertised give us? Why is it so hard and time consuming?

Tender has the goal to promote and foment the adoption. Its user experience is fun, enjoyable and secure, so the user can find the pet that best suits their resources and lifestyle. On the other hand you find a person close to you who is willing to take care of your pet temporarily if you have to move or will not be able to do it for a period of time.
